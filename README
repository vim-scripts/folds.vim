Checking long long log files are boring jobs especially those files contain
the continuous same lines. 
But why don\\&#039t you fold the continuous same lines with this \\\"folds.vim\\\".
It folds the continuous same lines more than 4 to 2 lines and one folded line.
Folds.vim contains
{range}Fold0: Fold the continuous same lines. No column arguments. 
{range}Fold1 c1 c2:
            Fold the continuous same lines of columns b/n c1 and c2.
{range}Fold2 c1 c2:
            Fold the continuous same lines ignoring columns b/n c1 and c2.
Note that column number c1 and c2 starts with 0, but not 1.
